# Breast Cancer Classifier (Deep Learning)
This code helps you classify malignant and benign tumors using Deep Learning.

### Code Requirements
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

### Python  Implementation

1) Dataset- UCI-ML
2) Instead of 0=benign and 1=malignant, I have used 1=benign and 2=malignant

### Execution
To run the code, type `python B_Cancer_DL.py`
